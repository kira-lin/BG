# BG
BG is a benchmark to evaluate performance of a data store for interactive social networking actions and sessions.  These actions and sessions either read or update a very small amount of the entire data set.

### Description

The documentation for this version of BG is similar to the one posted at [bgbenchmark.org](http://bgbenchmark.org/) with the following extensions:

1) Three decentralized techniques for generating meaningful actions.

2) Disjoint Database scales superlinearly as a function of nodes.

3) Integrated Database (Retain and Delegate) maybe more suitable to evaluate certain classes of data stores, see introduction of [database lab technical report  2018-01](http://dblab.usc.edu/Users/papers/bgscalable.pdf).

4) A hybrid technique that combines the strengths of Disjoint and Integrated Database.

For a complete description, see [database lab technical report  2018-01](http://dblab.usc.edu/Users/papers/bgscalable.pdf).

Running this version of BG is similar to the one posted at [bgbenchmark.org](http://bgbenchmark.org/) with the following additional parameters:
